    Google summer of code is a summer program in which students around the workd get paid to contribute to open source projects. Summer 2025 I am partecipating, building a symbolic integrator (a program that does indefinite integrals, finds primitives) for the Julia language. (<a href="https://github.com/Bumblebee00/SymbolicIntegration.jl">github repo</a>) This program works by applying integration rules on the integrand based on it's form. I didn't write the rules myself but I am taking them from a Mathematica package called <a href="https://rulebasedintegration.org/">Rubi</a>.
    I am halfway trough my working period, here are some stats:
    <li>158 commits</li>
    <li>1232 terminal commands executed</li>
    <li>164 times i executed the script to transalte rules files</li>
    <li>I transalted 18 rules files</li>
    Here are the dates of commands on my terminal plotted:
